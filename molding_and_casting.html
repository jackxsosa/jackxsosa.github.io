            <h3></h3>
            <p>For this mold the first step was finding something cool. I scrolled online and found a Spider-Man pendant that I could 3D print. The next class, I built a small styrofoam box so that I can make the mold. I glued the pendant down so that it wouldn’t move around. Next I made a silicone solution and poured it in the box. I left this for a day or two for the silicone to cure. The next class, I ripped open the box and removed the new mold. The next step was to cast it with resin. I mixed a solution and put it in the vacuum chamber. 
                This removed any bubbles from it. Then I poured it, leaving it for a while. The next class, I peeled it out. The resin poured around it a little bit so I had to peel some extra resin off. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a lot of pictures, so there are only a couple. Here they are:

            <h3></h3>
            <p>This mold proved to be much more challenging for me. I started by trying to figure out what to mold. My friend showed me a small 3D print he had of the Hylian Shield from the Legend Of Zelda games. I decided to use this to make my mold. I started with a block of clay and pressed half of the shield into it. I then made a box of styrofoam around the clay. I then poured silicone and let it cure. The next day, I removed the box and the clay, leaving the mold with the shield still pressed in it. I then made another box around it and poured the silicone to make the other half of the mold. However, there was a small hole in the box and I couldn’t recover it. 
                I ran out of time, so I had to wait until the next class to try again, but the same thing happened. On my third attempt, I was able to successfully build the box and pour the silicone. The next day I removed the box and cut a hole in the mold so that I can pour resin into it. I again used a vacuum chamber and poured it into the mold. The next class, I took apart the mold and the shield came out really nice. Sadly, I again forgot to take a lot of pictures, so I am working with a friend to get photos of his two part mold in order to showcase the process of making a two part mold. Here are some photos:
