            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I used KiCAD to design a circuit that takes a power source and runs an output component (LED). This documentation tracks my design process with step-by-step explanations and images of each stage.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Setting Up A Sketch</h3>
                <p>In this step, I opened KiCAD and opened up a blank sketch</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Creating the Schematic</h3>
                <p>In this step, I designed the schematic for the circuit by connecting the power source to the output component. I used KiCAD's schematic editor to arrange the components and ensure correct connections.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Routing the PCB</h3>
                <p>After completing the schematic, I switched to the PCB layout editor in KiCAD to place the components on a PCB and route the connections. I took into account the size and layout for optimal performance.</p>

                <p>In this final step, I reviewed the design to ensure all connections were correct. I then generated the Gerber files for fabrication, which would be sent to a PCB manufacturer if produced physically.</p>
