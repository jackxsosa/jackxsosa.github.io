            <h2>Part 1: 3D Printed Design</h2>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>For our 3D design, we had to create a model that was made only with additive features. The thing is, it had to be impossible to make with subtractive features. This stumped me for a while as I was confused by what it meant, but eventually I was able to figure it out. I decided to make a cubed frame with a ball on the inside. I started with the frame. I chose the top view and created four squares on the corners. I then extruded them and made beams. 
                I then made a side view and made the same squares and extruded those. After I made a frame, I created a projected view in the center. This is what I would use for my sphere. I then created a sketch and made a semicircle. I made sure to add a little nub on the bottom that would support the ball while it was printing. I then used the revolve tool to create my ball. Next, I exported the .stl file so that I may print it. When we first tried to print it, the printer wasn’t feeding the filament into the printer. 
                However, my friend was able to fix the printer and I was able to print it by the end of the day and remove the supports. It came out without any issues or faults.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: 3D Scanning</h2>
            <h3>Scanning Process</h3>
            <p>For our 3D scan, me and my friend decided to scan my head. This proved to be more challenging than I had expected. To start off we tried the Scaniverse App to scan my head, but it didn’t work too well. Our next best option was to use the Creality Ferret Pro Scanner that we had in our classroom. I downloaded and set up the app so that I can pair it to the scanner. Next I took out the scanner, put it together and tried to pair it. It took a couple tries, but eventually it worked. I then sat in a chair while my friend circled around me. It took many tries because I kept laughing or blinking, which would make the scan seem super weird. Another problem that we had to deal with was my hair. The scanner wouldn’t pick it up because it reflected too much, so we shined our phone flashlights on it so that it would scan correctly. After many failures, we got a pretty decent scan. At first I wanted to 3D print it so that I could have a 3D print of my head. Once we tried exporting it and putting it on my laptop, it kept on having issues, so we scrapped the idea.
