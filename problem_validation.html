                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>Understanding the response of plants to microgravity and their ability to develop stress resistance and adapt to a spaceflight environment is vital to the advancement of space biology. However, while in a spacecraft, plants are also exposed to ionizing radiation. The research in this article takes both stressors (microgravity and ionizing radiation) into account. 
                        The process of autophagy plays a crucial role in stress resistance. This study uses Arabidopsius thaliana and Pisum sativum (pea plants) as model organisms. 
                        When A. thaliana was tested in a clinostat compared to control plants, after 12 days, the autophagosomes in clinostated and control plants became practically identical. 
                        These finding support the gradual adaptation of plants in a micro-gravity simulation. Another study investigated the compared effects of microgravity and gamma radiation on autophagy and cytogenetics in pea seedlings to mimic spaceflight conditions. 
                        Overall, the study shows that gamma radiation causes dose-dependent cytogenetic and physiological changes, including enhanced autophagy and PCD. It also reveals a plateau in chromosomal aberrations at higher radiation doses, potentially reflecting homeostatic mechanisms and plant adaptation.

                        The study also looks into melatonin's potential as a stress-reduction tool in environments similar to space. By scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and controlling NO levels, melatonin improves root growth and stress resistance, which helps plants become more resilient in artificial microgravity. 
                        The study emphasizes the role that autophagy and NO signaling play in plant adaptation and proposes that modifying these pathways—perhaps with the help of substances like melatonin—might enhance plant growth in space, an essential function for long-duration space missions.</p>

                    <p>This piece of research supports that in a microgravity setting, the plants were able to adapt. It also reveals that gamma radiation causes dose-dependent cryogenic and physiological changes, including enhanced autophagy. The article also shows how melatonin can be used as a stress-reliever and improve root growth. 
                        This artifact provides validity and shows us how this problem is viable, and past successes.</p>

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>This study explores the effects of simulated microgravity, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and cow dung on the growth of Zea mays (corn) in crude oil-contaminated soil. Crude oil contamination hurts plant growth tremendously. This contamination affects water and oxygen absorption, reduces chlorophyll formation, and limits overall biomass. In order to overcome this, the scientists used a clinostat to simulate microgravity conditions while also adding cow dung, a natural fertilizer, and IAA, a plant growth regulator, to contaminated soils. The objective was to evaluate if these treatments could improve plant height, chlorophyll content, and biomass production in such a stressful environment. Over the course of 12 weeks, plant growth measurements, including height, chlorophyll index, and biomass, were recorded and analyzed.
                        The results showed that combining microgravity, IAA, and cow dung helped the plants grow significantly taller and healthier, especially when IAA and cow dung were used together. Cow dung also helped break down the crude oil by introducing microbes that degrade hydrocarbons, making the soil better for plant growth. This suggests that using these methods could be a good way to help plants grow in polluted areas, especially where there’s crude oil contamination.

When mixing fertilizer and IAA together in a microgravity setting, plants grew extremely healthy, even in contaminated soil. This is very helpful for our project. It shows the successes of mixing cow dung and IAA in a microgravity setting. This further confirms the validity of the project by discussing past attempts.</p>
