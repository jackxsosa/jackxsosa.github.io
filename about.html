                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jack Xavier Sosa. I've been a student at Belen since sixth grade. I started taking STEAM courses in my eigth grade year, 
                    navigating through Robotics,then segueing to Introduction to Engineering Design, until I finally reached Honors Design and Innovation in my senior year. 
                    Ever since I was a little kid, I always enjoyed building cool things with LEGO bricks. This is where my interest in engineering was born. 
                    Now at Belen, I am able to take this passion and utilize it in the real world.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Outside of school, my favorite pastime is probably listening to music or hanging out with friends. I also used to enjoy learning and researching about computers,
                    until I finally got my own that I use to play videogames with friends. I also run Track and Field, and go to the gym. Exercise really helps me destress and generally 
                    makes me feel better. On the weekends, I used to work at Publix Supermarkets. Here I would bag groceries, collect shopping carts, and sometimes even cashier. During 
                    the summer I worked at my school's summercamp. These two jobs helped make me more responsible and kept me busy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my work through this website. I'm excited to share my projects and the process behind them.
