        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>November 7, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Absent</h4>
            <p>On this day I was absent due to a school retreat. Another member of my group worked on a cardboard prototype, which we decided to scrap for now.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>November 12, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Initial Design Concept Document</h4>
            <p>On this day I was looking over the Initial Design Concept document. I still had to reformat some things and input information. 
                We also had to figure out what our prototype would be because we scrapped the cardboard design and didn’t have a physical prototype at the time.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>November 14, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Slip Ring Research and 3D Printing</h4>
            <p>On this day we looked over YouTube videos of slip rings. We found a good one explaining the use of a slip ring and that also gave us .stl files for a clinostat that we could use for our prototype. 
                We realized that a slip ring would help us not get our wires tangled while the machine was in motion. We ordered the slip ring and 3D printed the prototype. Next, we needed to assemble it.</p>

            <h3>November 18, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Met With Mario and Working On document</h4>
            <p>One of the group members took home the 3D print and assembled it over the weekend. When we got back on Monday, we met with Mario Cruz who has been our contact with Fairchild regarding the clinostat project. 
                After we met with him, I continued to add more information to the Initial Design Concept Document. I still wanted to reformat the document, especially the cost section.</p>

            <h3>November 20, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Worked On Document, Specifically Cost. Also Updated Website</h4>
            <p>On this day, I began by using ChatGPT to help me create a graph for the project costs. This came out really good and I imported it into the document. After this, I worked on my website. I embedded the google doc of the Initial Design Concept document into my website, 
                which I had been meaning to do for a while. Next, I have to finish the document and help my team upscale the prototype for when we meet with Mario Cruz in person.</p>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>November 22, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Wooden Puzzle</h4>
            <p>On this day, my group was focusing on their websites and catching up. I decided to use my time to finish a past project that I had failed. I was creating a small wooden “puzzle” of a bird, but I cut it way too big last time. 
                So I cut it again today, but it was too small. On my third try, I cut it correctly and was able to put it together successfully. Next class we are going to focus on continuing our final project.</p>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>December 3, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: PDR</h4>
            <p>On this day, I began working on the Preliminary Design Review. This document breaks down my project and gives an overview of costs, designs, and future plans. 
                Next class we have to finish up the document to submit it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>December 5, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Continued PDR</h4>
            <p>On this day, my group continued working on the document. We shared it with our teacher and split up the different sections. 
                We finished the document soon after and submitted it. Next class we have to make a script for a video version of our PDR that will eventually be posted on social media.</p>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>December 9, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Absent/PDR Video</h4>
            <p>On this day, I was absent. In class, my team met with Mario Cruz, our mentor for the project. At home, I helped record voice over for our PDR video and then we submitted it. Soon we have to post it on our school’s social media, which will allow more people to see it, including our school’s stakeholders and investors.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="log-entry">
            <h3>December 11, 2024</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: Website Housekeeping</h4>
            <p>On this day, I worked on my website. I added some pictures and updated the computer controlled cutting section. This was something that I had been meaning to catch up on, but I have been focused on the main project the last few days. 
                Also, I embedded the PDR document under the solution design tab, which replaced the initial design concept document. Next we have to create a secondary prototype, incorporating our LED panels.</p>

            <h3>January 6, 2025</h3>
            <h4>Update Title: 3D Modeling</h4>
            <p>On this day, I started working on my non-subtractive 3D model. I used Fusion 360 to create my model. I hadn’t really used Fusion in a while, but after a little while of playing around, I was able to figure out how to make my model. 
                Next class I have to print out my model and decide what I will 3D scan.</p>

            <h4>Update Title: 3D Printing and Website Housekeeping</h4>
            <p>On this day, I spent time exporting the .stl file of my 3D model to send it to print. I was able to get the print at the end of the day without it having any faults. 
                I also spent some time organizing my website and adding some code. Next class I have to 3D scan the object I chose, which was my head.</p>

            <h4>Update Title: 3D Scanning</h4>
            <p>On this day, me and my friend spent most of the time 3D scanning my head. It took a couple tries, but we were able to get it done. We used the creality scan app and scanner. 
                Next class we have to measure our metal bars for our final project so that we can soon cut them and put them together.</p>

            <h4>Update Title: BLDC Motors</h4>
            <p>Over the weekend, it was my job to research what kind of BLDC motors we could use. I tried looking for some with good torque and durability. 
                In class, our teacher helped us find one for a really good price. After we recieve the motors, we can continue building our real clinostat prototype. 
                Next class, we have to construct and test.</p>

            <h4>Update Title: Testing Set-Up</h4>
            <p>On this day, my team was able to figure out how to get readings on our XRP chip, allowing us to get acceleration data. Next, we mouinted the chip on our 3D-Modeled Clinostat. 
                However, we weren't able to test yet because we ran out of time. Next class, we have to test the XRP accelerometer chip.</p>
