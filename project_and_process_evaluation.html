                <h2>Project and Process Evaluation</h2>
                <p> This project has been an exciting adventure. This past year I have learned so much and have gotten to expereince many cool things. This project has really put me to the test and has challenged me in a team setting. 
                    This is of course a legacy project, so we will be passing on our work to a new team in the future, manily to figure out the water situation. 
                    We have made tremendous progress, but of cousre there is still so much more work to be done to accomplish the goals of the Growing Beyond Earth project. There of course were times where we could have been more efficient. 
                    If we would have organized better our roles and deadlines, we may have been able to make more progress. There were also time where we spent too much time on a single action item. Overall, better time management would have been very useful.
