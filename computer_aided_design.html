        <section class="documentation-section">
            <h2>3D CAD Prototype</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used a 3D CAD program to design a simple prototype of my final project. The prototype includes general dimensions, but they are not final.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Chose OnShape:</strong> I chose to use OnShape because of my prior expereince of the program and the simplicity of it, that is useful for a basic model.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step process of how I created the 3D model.</p>

            <!-- Screenshot 1 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 1: Base</h4>
                <img src="images/3D1.PNG" alt="Step 1 Screenshot">
                <p>I began by sketching out a base for the clinostat. 
                    I then extruded it, but I extruded the middle less than the sides, which will hold up the machine.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Screenshot 2 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 2: Outer Shell</h4>
                <img src="images/3D2.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Then, I designed the outershell for the clinostat, which is on an axis attached to the sides. 
                    The outer shell has a rod inside for the inner compartments to spin around.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 3: Second Tier</h4>
                <img src="images/3D3.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>In this step, I made the mid-tier shell, which will eventually hold the inner tier, which has the inner compartment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 4: Inner Tier</h4>
                <img src="images/3D4.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here, I made the shell for the inner compartment. 
                    This is the very center point of the clinostat, where the plant would technically be held.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 5: Closed Compartments</h4>
                <img src="images/3D5.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Then, I finished closing in the compartments. 
                    All the tiers are closed in and are able to rotate on an axis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 6: Final Rendition</h4>
                <img src="images/3D6.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>This is an angled fronyt view of my design. 
                    This shows all the compartments at once and it is simple to see how it would work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 7: Dimensions</h4>
                <img src="images/3D7.jpg" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>This displays the rough estimate of the dimensions of how a prototype of the clinostat would be. 
                    This is by no means the final dimensions or even the sizing that we will use in our final project.</p>

        <!-- 2D CAD Logo Design Section -->
        <section class="documentation-section">
            <h2>2D CAD Logo Design</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used Affinity Design to create a logo draft for our makeshift company running the project.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Chose Affinity Design:</strong> I selected Affinity Design because of its many useful tools and capabilites, and its versatility for logo creation.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step documentation of how I designed the logo. Each step includes screenshots and explanations.</p>

            <!-- Screenshot 1 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 1: Initial Shape</h4>
                <img src="images/2D1.PNG" alt="Logo Step 1 Screenshot">
                <p>To start, I created a simplpe shape. I wanted it to look like a crescent moon. 
                    I then filled it with a yellow coloring that darkened towards the bottom.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Screenshot 2 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 2: Center Oval</h4>
                <img src="images/2D2.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Next, I created a blue oval in the center of the moon shape. This will hold the rest of my design. 
                    I colored it blue, kind of like a sky background.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 3: Hill</h4>
                <img src="images/2D3.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>In this step, I created a green mound. 
                    This was supposed to be a hill top.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 4: Tree Trunk</h4>
                <img src="images/2D4.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Next I created a brown tree trunk. 
                    I added a darker brown blob in the middle to show a kind of hole in the tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 5: Tree Leaves</h4>
                <img src="images/2D5.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>I finished up the tree by adding a bush of leaves to the top.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 6: Creating Background</h4>
                <img src="images/2D6.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here, I started to create a background for the logo, that was automatically set to green.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 7: Space Background</h4>
                <img src="images/2D7.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>I changed the background to a dark purple, to represent outer space.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 8: Stars</h4>
                <img src="images/2D8.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Finally, I added stars as finishing touches to the background.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 9: Final Logo</h4>
                <img src="images/2D9.JPG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here, my final logo is shown. It is a moon in space, with a tree in the middle of it.</p>
            </div>
