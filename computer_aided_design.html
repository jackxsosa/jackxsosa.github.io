            <h2>3D CAD Prototype</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used a 3D CAD program to design a simple prototype of my final project. The prototype includes general dimensions, but they are not final.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Chose OnShape:</strong> I chose to use OnShape because of my prior expereince of the program and the simplicity of it that is useful for a basic model.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step process of how I created the 3D model. This includes why I made specific design choices and how I used the programâ€™s features.</p>

        <section class="documentation-section">
            <h2>2D CAD Logo Design</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used a 2D CAD program (such as Affinity Design) to create a logo draft for the makeshift company running this project.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Chose [2D CAD Program]:</strong> I selected [Affinity Design, Illustrator, etc.] because of its precision in vector design and its versatility for logo creation.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step documentation of how I designed the logo. Each step includes screenshots and explanations.</p>
