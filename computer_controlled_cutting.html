            <h2>Vinyl Cutter</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used Affinity Designer to create a vinyl sticker just for personal use. I made the Batman logo just becasue Batman is one of my favorite superheroes.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step process of how I created the vinyl sticker. Each step includes screenshots and explanations.</p>

            <!-- Screenshot 1 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 1: Outline</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl1.PNG" alt="Step 1 Screenshot">
                <p>I started by importing an outline of the Batman symbol so that I can trace it to make the sticker look as accurate as possible.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Screenshot 2 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 2: Trace</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl2.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>This was my sketch of the bat. I traced it, but there were some spots that didn't come out perfect. I decided to keep the imperfections and just continue on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 3: Fill</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl3.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here, I filled in the bat to make it a solid black.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 4: Black Oval</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl4.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Next, I made the bottom layer. I made a black oval as the bottom part of the sticker.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 5: Yellow Oval</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl5.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>I then made the second layer, which was a smaller yellow oval.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 6: Background</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl6.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here I put the yellow oval over the balck oval, creating the background of the sticker where the bat will be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 7: Final Sticker</h4>
                <img src="images/vinyl7.PNG" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Finally, I put the bat into place, creating the final product.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 8: Final Cut Out</h4>
                <img src="images/IMG_0272.jpg" alt="Step 2 Screenshot">

            <h2>Laser Cutter</h2>
            <p>In this section, I used Fusion 360 and Affinity Designer to design a three piece puzzle that would be laser cut. I decided to make a bird with the three pieces being the main body, the tail, and the feet. </p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step documentation of how I designed the puzzle. Each step includes screenshots and explanations.</p>

            <!-- Screenshot 1 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 1: Head</h4>
                <img src="images/laser1.jpg" alt="Logo Step 1 Screenshot">
                <p>I began by sketching the bird's head and beak.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Screenshot 2 -->
            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 2: Torso</h4>
                <img src="images/laser2.jpg" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Next, I created a torso which attached to the head. I added slits on the back and bottom where the other puzzle pieces would fit in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 3: Tail</h4>
                <img src="images/laser3.jpg" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Here I sketched a tail that would interlock with the back of the torso.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 4: Feet</h4>
                <img src="images/laser4.jpg" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Then, I made the feet of the bird that would connect to the bottom of the torso.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 5: Top View</h4>
                <img src="images/laser5.jpg" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>This is a top view of all of my sketches.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 6: Isometric View</h4>
                <img src="images/laser6.jpg" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>This is an isometric view of all the finish puzzle pieces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">
                <h4>Step 7: Imported into Affinity Designer</h4>
                <img src="images/laser7.PNG" alt="Logo Step 2 Screenshot">
                <p>In this step, I imported the sketches into Affinity Designer. Here, I can save them as a pdf so that I can send them to be laser cut.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="screenshot-box">

                <p>Here is my puzzle after it was cut out. It ended up being a little bit messed up so I have to redesign and cut it out.</p>
